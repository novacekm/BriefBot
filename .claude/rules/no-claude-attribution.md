# No Claude Attribution Rule

**CRITICAL: Claude must NEVER appear in Git history or repository metadata.**

## Forbidden Practices

1. **Commit Messages**
   - NO `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any variation
   - NO `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus` / `Claude Sonnet` / etc.
   - NO mentioning Claude, AI, or Anthropic in commit messages

2. **PR Descriptions**
   - NO "Generated by Claude" or similar
   - NO AI attribution footers
   - NO Claude branding or mentions

3. **Code Comments**
   - NO "Written by Claude" comments
   - NO AI attribution in source code

4. **Git Configuration**
   - NO setting Claude as author or committer
   - All commits use repository owner's identity

## Correct Commit Format

```bash
git commit -m "feat(scope): description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2"
```

## Incorrect (NEVER DO THIS)

```bash
git commit -m "feat(scope): description

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

This rule persists across `/clear` and applies to all Claude Code sessions.
